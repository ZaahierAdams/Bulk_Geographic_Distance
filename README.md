# Bulk Geographic Distance

## About 
Calculates in bulk (i)distances, (ii) forward and (iii) reverse azimuth between two points in geographical coordinates (ϕ,λ) using:
- [Haversine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) formula 
- Geodesic distance using WGS84 ellipsoid


## Getting started
- Install: [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [Pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/), [pyproj](https://pypi.org/project/pyproj/)
- Insert coordinates into ```input.xlsx``` 
- Run ```BulkGeographicDistance.py```
